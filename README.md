# CAD Automation Projects
### Calibre based Signal Tracer
- Wrote a SVRF runset to trace the input Signals and dump it in stream-in Library.
### Floating Net Check
- Extracted all floating nets from SPF using Python and traced it through Calibre runset.
### Finding Available Routing Area
- Calibre runset based utility to highlight the available routing area for particular metals.
### Metal Cell Generation of a module for any hierarchy
- SKILL + SVRF runset based utility to create layout & schematic View of Metal Cell.
- Extract all metals which are crossing over the Module from top-level design to module-level.
### LVS Extraction Report Update to Add comment on text open merge error
- SKILL-based utility to identify text open merge errors and classify each error as PIN/NET.
### Text short on specified net
- SVRF runset to trace nets, extract all overlapping labels, and report them in a DFM RDB.
### Metal Patch cell generation for DRC Error Fix
- SVRF runset to generate metal patch cell GDS for specific metal run-length DRC error.
### STD Cell Power Sharing to reduce layout Area
- SKILL-based utility to identify and highlight standard cells eligible for power sharing.
### Calibre CTO File Generation & Optimization for DRC Runset
- Calibre run for CTO file extraction & optimized Rule Check categories using Python.
### Label & SPF based signal Mark Net
- SKILL and Python-based script to mark nets using label or SPF signal coordinates.
